# Machine Learning-for-building-a-predictive-classifier

The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of several learning machines for building a
predictive classifier to evaluate, thanks to infrasound records, the (low or high) quantity of
ice at a given spot in the Groenland. In this application, there are 4 potential target ouputs
corresponding to infrasound signals (Y1, Y3, Y4, Y5) (file Targets.csv). The covariables are
defined by 9 variables providing by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF
